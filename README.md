# ElectricDischargeInsectControlSystem

### Introduction
AIM: To design an electric mesh that can prevent the insects from entering the closed premises and can protect humans from them. Before we dwell into the project, let's first understand importance of it and know a bit of history.

The Mosquito netting has a long history, and its known as one of the first forms of protection used. It is said that Cleopatra, the last active pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, also slept under a mosquito net. Mosquito nets were also used during the malaria-plagued construction of the Suez Canal. As the time passed, a few more insect repellents came into existence, but one of the things which is widely used in households other than mosquito nets or mesh is a Mosquito Killer Racket. A Taiwanese
inventor, Tsao-I Shih, is often credited with inventing the modern mosquito racket; he filed for a patent for an "electronic insect-killing swatter" in 1996. The racket offers an effective alternative to other mosquito repelling/killing solutions; it does not use harmful chemicals or require expensive refills, does not produce smoke or fumes, and ensures that the insect is dead. There were many modifications done to the Mosquito racket, like enhancing the swiping speed and operation angle, providing a shock absorbing effect by changing the body frame and using 9 other materials for construction. (Kuel-Tzu Su, Taichung County, Nov 29, 2007)
But, to kill the mosquitoes using the racket, human involvement is necessary. Hence, by joining the racket concept and the mesh, we are making an electric mesh. This mesh will not only help to prevent the insects to enter inside closed households but will also kill them.
